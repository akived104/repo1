13. Portability - you can run your Python program across Windows, Mac OS, and Linux without modifying the program code
    write less do more
    extensive libraries
    used extensively in machine learning, data science etc
14. Python uses the dynamic memory allocation which is managed by the Heap data structure. Memory Heap holds the objects and other data structures that will be used in the program. Python memory manager manages the allocation or de-allocation of the heap memory space through the API functions.
15. Install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (first download then install) . Check where it's installed on the system copy the path. Now go to advanced system settings add new variable name it as PYTHON_Name and paste the copied path
